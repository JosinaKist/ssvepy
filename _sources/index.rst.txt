Welcome to ssvepy.
==================

``ssvepy`` is apackage to analyse MNE-formatted EEG data for steady-state visually evoked potentials, or other evoked frequencies (be it auditory, thermosensory, tactile or otherwise).

Use ``ssvepy`` *after* you process your data with MNE-python. You want to get your data pre-processed and epoched, as the main ``ssvepy`` function accepts objects of the :class:`mne:mne.Epochs` class.
