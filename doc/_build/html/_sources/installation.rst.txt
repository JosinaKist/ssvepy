Install
=======

It's pretty easy!

::

    pip install git+https://github.com/janfreyberg/ssvepy.git

As always with pip packages, you can install a "development" version of this package by (forking and) cloning the git repository and installing it via ``pip install -e /path/to/package``.

Please open a pull request if you make improvements!
